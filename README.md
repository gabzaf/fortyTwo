# 42 Porto Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I've completed during my time at 42 Porto, a programming school focused on teaching computer science fundamentals through a project-based learning approach. This repository contains a collection of projects developed in C, as well as additional challenges and experiences that have shaped my journey in software development.

### About 42 Porto

42 is a future-proof computer science program that immerses students in a peer-to-peer learning environment. Through hands-on projects, students refine their problem-solving skills, master fundamental and advanced programming concepts, and collaborate with peers to build robust solutions to complex problems.

My experience at 42 Porto has been transformative, allowing me to continuously develop my technical expertise and gain practical insights into software engineering.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into different sections, each representing a key phase of my learning journey at 42 Porto.

📌 Cursus (Core Projects)

These are the core projects of the 42 curriculum that helped me develop a strong foundation in C programming, algorithmic thinking, systems programming, problem-solving, code reviews/communication, and code collaboration:

libft – Custom implementation of a standard C library.

ft_printf – Recreating the C printf function.

get_next_line – Handling file reading with dynamic memory management.

fdf – A 3D wireframe visualization project.

push_swap – Algorithmic sorting problem focused on stack operations.

minitalk – Inter-process communication using UNIX signals.

net_practice – Network simulation exercises for understanding IP routing and subnetting.

🎓 Exams

At 42 Porto, exams are a fundamental part of evaluating our problem-solving skills. I have successfully completed exams up to rank 4, demonstrating proficiency in low-level programming and algorithm challenges.

🚀 Piscine

The Piscine is an intensive one-month coding bootcamp that serves as an introduction to 42’s learning methodology. It includes daily exercises and projects focused on:

C programming fundamentals

Problem-solving techniques

Shell scripting & UNIX commands

Collaborative coding

🏆 Hackathon

I participated in the Hackathon Sogrape, a challenge-based event designed to simulate real-world industry scenarios. One of the key challenges involved:

Web Scraping & Data Collection

User Interaction with Displayed Data

This experience reinforced my ability to work under pressure, think critically, and develop efficient solutions in a team environment.
