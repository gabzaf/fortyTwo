# 42 Porto Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I've completed during my time at 42, a programming school dedicated to teaching computer science fundamentals and practical skills. 
This repository contains a collection of projects developed in the C programming language, covering a wide range of topics and concepts.

At 42, students engage in hands-on learning experiences, working on projects that challenge their **problem-solving** abilities and foster collaboration with peers. 
Each project is designed to reinforce key concepts in computer science, such as data structures, algorithms, memory management and software engineering principles.

## About 42: 
42 is a future-proof computer science training program aimed at educating the next generation of software engineers. 
The 42 program adopts a project-based approach to learning, fostering the development of **technical and interpersonal** skills that align with the demands of the job market.

My experience at 42 has been transformative, allowing me to continually develop my skills and knowledge in computer science. 
By focusing on practical skills and real-world projects, 42 equips students with the tools they need to succeed in their careers.

## About the Projects:
The projects in this repository cover a diverse range of topics, from basic programming exercises to complex algorithms and system-level programming. 
Each project comes with its own set of requirements and objectives, challenging students to apply their knowledge in creative ways.

Throughout my journey at 42, I've honed my problem-solving skills, learned to work effectively in teams and gained a deeper understanding of computer science concepts. 
I'm excited to share my projects with you and hope they inspire others on their learning journey.
