# ft_printf

Welcome to ft_printf, a project that challenges to create my version of the printf function in C. This project is an exercise in string formatting, parsing and output handling in the C programming language.

## 1. Introduction
The printf function in C is a powerful tool for formatting and printing output to the console. 
The goal of the ft_printf project is to implement my own version of this function, capable of handling various format specifiers, flags and conversion specifiers.

## 2. Function Description
The ft_printf function has the following prototype:

`int ft_printf(const char *format, ...)`

This function takes a format string format as input, along with optional arguments depending on the format specifiers used in the string. 
It formats the output according to the format string and writes it to the standard output stream. The function returns the number of characters written.
