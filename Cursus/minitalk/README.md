# Minitalk
Welcome to Minitalk, a project that challenges to create a client-server communication system using **signals** in C. This project is an exercise in **interprocess communication** and signal handling in the Unix environment.

## 1. Introduction
Minitalk is a simple client-server program where the server waits for messages from the client and displays them, while the client sends messages to the server. 
The communication between the client and server is achieved using signals, allowing for lightweight and efficient message passing.

## 2. Usage
To use Minitalk, first start the server program in one terminal window:
Then, in another terminal window, start the client program with the server's process ID as an argument.
You can now start sending messages from the client to the server.

### *Note:* On unixProcessInC directory I implemented some functions to better understand signals.
