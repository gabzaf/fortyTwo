CIDR Notation - https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/network/cidr.html

A system called Classless Inter-Domain Routing, or CIDR, was developed as an alternative to traditional subnetting. The idea is that you can add a
specification in the IP address itself as to the number of significant bits that make up the routing or networking portion.
For example, we could express the idea that the IP address 192.168.0.15 is associated with the netmask 255.255.255.0 by using the CIDR notation of
192.168.0.15/24. This means that the first 24 bits of the IP address given are considered significant for the network routing.

There are two separate networks, but this time I need to set the mask and IP correctly.
For the network of A and B, they need the same mask, 255.255.255.224.
The available IP-addresses for A1 are 192.168.57.193 - 192.168.57.221.

Network C and D already have the same mask. So they just need addresses that are part of the same subnet.
In the case of the mask being /30 the subnet only consists of 2 available addresses per subnet. So be careful, to choose the correct ones. to
make things easier, I suggest you either start with the lowest or highest subnet.
I choose the highest, so my available IP-range is 192.168.57.253 - 192.168.57.254
