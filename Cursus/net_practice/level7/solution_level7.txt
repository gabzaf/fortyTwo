Level 7 presents three subnets, I just need to make sure that no network overlap with each other.

Interface R11 IP is fixed. Interface R12 IP is fixed.

The first goal will be to find an appropriate mask to use. Since I need 3 different subnets, by looking at the table I will be able to decide which
mask will be required. I have to choose a mask that makes 3 subnets at least.

So, the minimum value of mask that I can use is 255.255.255.192 or /26 which creates 4 subnets with 64 available IP addresses. The maximum value of
mask that I can use is 255.255.255.252 or in CIDR /30 because it provides 64 subnets, each having 2 usable IP-addresses.

Now I just need to fill the routing table:

Host C has to point to interface R22 IP address. Router R2 has to point to interface R12 IP address. And so on...
