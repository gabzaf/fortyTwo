Devices on a network, identified by their IP addresses, don’t inherently communicate with each other across different networks without some
mechanism to facilitate that communication. This is where routing and by extension, the router as a network gateway—comes into play. 

Every device on a network, whether it’s a computer, a smartphone or a router, is assigned an IP address that uniquely identifies it within that
network. Networks are typically segmented, think of them as separate islands. For example, my home Wi-Fi might be one network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24),
while my ISP’s network is another. By default, devices on one network can’t send packets directly to devices on a different network because they
lack a direct path. This is where the router steps in.

The router—serves as the connection between these networks. It has interfaces connected to multiple networks (e.g., one interface on my
local network and another on the ISP’s network). When a device on my network wants to send a packet to another network, it forwards the packet to
the router, which then decides where to send it next. This decision-making process is called routing.

Routing is the process of moving packets from one network to another. The router examines the destination IP address in each packet’s header and
determines the next step in its journey. To do this efficiently, the router relies on its routing table, which acts like a map or a set of
instructions telling it where to send packets based on their destination.

A routing table is a critical component of any router. It’s essentially a database stored in the router’s memory that lists paths—or routes—to
various network destinations. Each entry in the routing table provides specific information, typically including: Destination Network, Next Hop,
Interface, Metric and Gateway.

A simplified example of what a routing table might look like:

Destination     Gateway         Interface     Metric
192.168.1.0/24  -              eth0          1
10.0.0.0/24     192.168.1.1    eth0          2
0.0.0.0/0       203.0.113.1    eth1          10

- 192.168.1.0/24: Traffic to this local network goes directly out of eth0 (no gateway needed).
- 10.0.0.0/24: Traffic to this network is sent to the gateway 192.168.1.1 via eth0.
- 0.0.0.0/0: This is the default route. Any packet with a destination not matching the above entries is sent to 203.0.113.1 (e.g., your ISP’s router)
via eth1.

The default route (0.0.0.0/0) is especially important it’s the catch-all for traffic headed outside the local network, like when I'm browsing
the internet.

HOW ROUTING HAPPENS

Let’s walk through an example:

A device on my network (say, 192.168.1.10) wants to send a packet to a server at 8.8.8.8 (Google’s DNS server).
The device checks its own routing table. If it doesn’t know how to reach 8.8.8.8 directly, it sends the packet to its configured default gateway
(e.g., my router at 192.168.1.1).
The router receives the packet and consults its routing table. Since 8.8.8.8 doesn’t match any specific local network entry, it falls to the default
route (0.0.0.0/0), which points to the ISP’s gateway (e.g., 203.0.113.1).
The router forwards the packet out of the appropriate interface (eth1) to the ISP’s gateway. This process repeats across multiple routers on the
internet until the packet reaches 8.8.8.8.

Routing tables can be static (manually configured) or dynamic (updated automatically). In smaller networks, like my home Wi-Fi, the routing table
is often simple and static—just a default route to the ISP. In larger networks, routers use routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP, RIP) to exchange
information with other routers and dynamically update their tables. This ensures they always know the best path to a destination, even if network
conditions change (like a link going down).

In summary, the router, as the network gateway, enables communication between networks by using its routing table to intelligently forward packets.
The routing table is the brains of the operation, dictating which interface to use and where to send each packet next. Whether it’s a simple default
route to my ISP or a complex table in a corporate network, routing ensures that data gets where it needs to go, one hop at a time.

There is a routing table on level 5.
R1 has a fixed IP of 16.56.107.126 and a fixed mask of 255.255.255.128 and an IP-range of 16.56.107.1 - 16.56.107.125 for A1.

Now to conquer the routing table of A it is as easy as setting the destination as default or 0.0.0.0/0 and the destination has to be the IP of the
directly connected router R1, 80.103.79.126.

Same concept applies to connecting B to the R2.
