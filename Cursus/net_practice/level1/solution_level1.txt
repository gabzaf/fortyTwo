Devices need to find each other on a network to establish communications. These devices will use unique addresses or identifiers to locate each
other. The addresses will ensure that communications happens with the right device. These are called the IP and MAC addresses.

IP addresses allow network resources to be reached through a network interface. If one computer wants to communicate with another computer, it can
address the information to the remote computer’s IP address. Assuming that the two computers are on the same network, or that the different
computers and devices in between can translate requests across networks, the computers should be able to reach each other and send information.
Each IP address must be unique on its own network. Networks can be isolated from one another, and they can be bridged and translated to provide
access between distinct networks. A system called Network Address Translation, allows the addresses to be rewritten when packets traverse network
borders to allow them to continue on to their correct destination. This allows the same IP address to be used on multiple, isolated networks while
still allowing these to communicate with each other if configured correctly.

An IP address is a 32-bit number. It identifies a host (device) on a TCP/IP network. A typical IPv4 address looks something like this:
192.168.0.5. In binary notation: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000101

A subnet mask is used to divide an IP address into two parts. One part identifies the host and the other part identifies the network to which it
belongs. The traffic that goes trough a subnet can go to its destination with less hops without going through routers.
To understand how subnet maks are used to distinguish between hosts, networks and subnetworks, I need to examine an IP address in binary notation.

The networks can be categorized in three classes:
- A: The octet that its located before the first dot represents the network;
- B: The two octets that are located before the second dot represents the network;
- C: The tree octets that are located before the third dot represents the network;

There are two separate networks in the Level 1 exercise, each consisting of two computers. In order to make it work, the two computers need to be
part of the same network.
The mask of A and B is 255.255.255.0 the possible IP-adresses of A1 are 104.99.23.1 - 104.99.23.254.
For C and D the mask is 255.255.0.0, so the usable IPs are 211.191.0.1 - 211.191.255.254
