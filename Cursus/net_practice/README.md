# NetPractice

## Introduction

NetPractice is a networking project designed to help understand and apply fundamental networking concepts, particularly focusing on TCP/IP addressing. The project consists of solving a series of exercises where non-functional network configurations must be corrected to ensure proper communication between networked devices.

## Features

- Simulated network configuration exercises.

- Hands-on learning of TCP/IP addressing.

- 10 levels of increasing difficulty.

- Real-time feedback via a web-based training interface.

- Logs to assist in debugging configuration issues.

- Understanding and configuring routing tables.

## Installation & Setup

- Download the provided project file from the 42 Intranet.

- Extract the files to a preferred directory.

- Open index.html in a web browser to start the simulation.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding IP addressing and subnetting.

- Configuring network routes and gateways.

- Debugging network connectivity issues.

- Understanding and implementing routing tables.

- Applying practical networking concepts in a simulated environment.
