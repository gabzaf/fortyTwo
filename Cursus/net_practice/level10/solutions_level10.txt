There are two routers, one switch and internet in level 10.

Internet has a routing table with fixed IP for it. If a set the destination with /24 (255.255.255.0). So I have 8 bits to IP addresses to other
devices. The destination on Internet routing table is 154.184.123.0/24.
Interface R12 which connects the Internet and the router R1. R12 has 163.172.2510.12 with 255.255.255.240 or /28.



The easiest part will be the connection of H2 and H1 in their network.

Now we are setting up the H41-R23 network and its connection to the Internet.

The mask is fixed, so set it accordingly.
The IP of R23 is fixed by the routing table of H4, so set it to the correct one.
Now go along the route connecting it to the Internet, you will notice the mask of R21 is fixed so set the mask of R13 accordingly.
The routing table of R1 already has the default set, as a connection to the internet.
So now the package should be able to reach the Internet and only thing to fix is the routing table of the Internet.
For this to be correct we only need to change the CIDR of the destination, so it is able to communicate with all 158.103.36.x addresses.
This is done by changing the CIDR to /24, so it can reach 158.103.36.0 - 158.103.36.255.

The hardest part of this level will now be the setup of the R22-H31 network and the correct setup of the routing table of R1.
First, set the mask of R22 and H31 to 255.255.255.252 since we only need 2 usable IP-addresses and this creates the least problems with overlapping ip-ranges.
Second, you need an IP-range that is still free. For this, we will take a look at all of the other networks.
