A hub is a network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network. Think of a hub like a radio tower that broadcasts a signal
to any radio tuned to the correct frequency.
Another network device is a switch. A switch makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them.
A switch is more intelligent than a hub. It only passes data to the intended destination. This makes switches more secure than hubs, and enables
them to control the flow of traffic and improve network performance. A switch forwards packets between devices directly connected to it. It maintains
a MAC address table that matches MAC addresses of devices on the network to port numbers on the switch and forwards incoming data packets according
to the destination MAC address.

There is a Switch on level 3.
Since we can't manipulate the mask of C, 255.255.255.128 or /25 will be the mask of the whole network.
The subnet mask 255.255.255.128 (/25) means the network portion of the IP address uses 25 bits, leaving 7 bits for host addresses. This divides a
standard Class C network (256 addresses with a /24 mask) into two subnets, each with 128 addresses (2^(32-25) = 2^7 = 128).
- Subnet size: 128 IP addresses per subnet. First subnet: 104.198.245.0 to 104.198.245.127. Second subnet: 104.198.245.128 to 104.198.245.255.
- Usable host addresses: 128 - 2 = 126 (subtracting the network [104.198.245.0] and broadcast addresses [104.198.245.127]).

All three computers must be in the same subnet because they’re connected via a switch. Given the computer with IP 104.198.245.125 is in the
104.198.245.0/25 subnet, the other two must also have IPs in the usable range of this subnet:
104.198.245.1 to 104.198.245.126. The other two can use any two addresses from the remaining 125 usable addresses in that range
(excluding 104.198.245.125).
