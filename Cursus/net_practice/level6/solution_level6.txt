Internet appears on Level 6.
IP of A1 is fixed. The mask of R1 is fixed, which A1 is connected to through the switch. So we need to match those in order for them to be in the
same network. Mask for this network will be 255.255.255.128.
Combined with the A1 fixed IP of 72.107.242.227 one subnet will be from 72.107.242.1 to 72.107.242.126 and the other 72.107.242.129 - 72.107.242.254.
In order for R1 and A1 to be in the same network, the possible address-range of R1 will be 72.107.242.129 - 72.107.242.254.

Now set the routing table of A in order to reach R1.
The destination of the routing table of the internet needs to be set to the network address of the R1-A1 network, which in this case is 29.65.6.128,
combined with the CIDR of the network, which is /25. This results in a next hop of 29.65.6.128/25.

Destination of the routing table of the router can be set to default or 0.0.0.0/0.
