# FdF
Welcome to FdF, a project that challenges to create a simple 3D wireframe renderer using the miniLibX graphic library in C. 
This project is an exercise in computer graphics, allowing to visualize 3D landscapes represented by height maps.

## 1. Introduction
FdF stands for "Fils de Fer" in French, which translates to "Wireframe" in English. 
In this project, the goal is to create a program that reads a file representing a map of the landscape and renders it as a wireframe model on the screen. 
I used the miniLibX graphic library to manage windows and draw lines.

## 2. Getting Started
To get started with FdF, clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the FdF directory and run make. This will clone a repo of minilibx-linux a simple X-Window (X11R6) programming API in C, designed for students, suitable for X-beginners.

## 3. Functionality
The FdF program reads a file containing a map of the landscape, where each number represents the height of a point on the grid. 
It then renders this map as a wireframe model on the screen, allowing to explore the landscape from different angles and perspectives.

## 4. Usage
To use FdF, run ./fdf testmaps/42.fdf or any other maps you want on your terminal. Search testmaps directory to check out the different maps.

Happy coding!
