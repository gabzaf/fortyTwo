# FdF
Welcome to FdF, a project that challenges to create a simple 3D wireframe renderer using the miniLibX graphic library in C. 
This project is an exercise in computer graphics, allowing to visualize 3D landscapes represented by height maps.

## 1. Introduction
FdF stands for "Fils de Fer" in French, which translates to "Wireframe" in English. 
In this project, the goal is to create a program that reads a file representing a map of the landscape and renders it as a wireframe model on the screen. 
I used the miniLibX graphic library to manage windows and draw lines.

## 2. Getting Started
To get started with FdF, clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the FdF directory and compile the project using your preferred compiler.
This will generate an executable file named fdf.

## 3. Functionality
The FdF program reads a file containing a map of the landscape, where each number represents the height of a point on the grid. 
It then renders this map as a wireframe model on the screen, allowing to explore the landscape from different angles and perspectives.

## 4. Usage
To use FdF, run the executable file with a map file as an argument

Happy coding!
