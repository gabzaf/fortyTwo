### 1. Introduction
In the world of C programming, having access to a library of useful functions is essential for writing efficient and reliable code. 
The purpose of libft is to provide me with my own library of functions that I can use in future projects. 
By implementing these functions from scratch, I'll gain a deeper understanding of how they work and improve my programming skills.

### 2. Getting Started
To get started with libft, simply clone this repository to your local machine.

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the libft directory and compile the library using your preferred compiler.
This will generate a static library file named `libft.a` that you can link with your C programs.

### 3. Functions
The libft library contains a variety of functions across different categories, including:

* String manipulation functions
* Memory manipulation functions
* Character classification functions
* Conversion functions
* And more...

For a complete list of functions available in libft, please refer to the `libft.h` header file.

### 4. Testing
Testing functions is an important part of the development process.
