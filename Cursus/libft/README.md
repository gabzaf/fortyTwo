# libft
Welcome to libft, a project aimed at creating my own **C library** consisting of commonly used functions. 
This project serves as a foundational exercise in C programming, it helped me deepen my understanding of libC functions and improved my coding skills.

### 1. Introduction
In the world of C programming, having access to a library of useful functions is essential for writing efficient and reliable code. 
The purpose of libft is to provide me with my own library of functions that I can use in future projects. 
By implementing these functions from scratch, I'll gain a deeper understanding of how they work and improve my programming skills.

### 2. Functions
The libft library contains a variety of functions across different categories, including:

* String manipulation functions
* Memory manipulation functions
* Character classification functions
* Conversion functions
* And more...

For a complete list of functions available in libft, please refer to the `libft.h` header file.
